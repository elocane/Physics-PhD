# Physics-PhD

Here I will share some of the projects I worked on during my PhD. My field is theoretical quantum physics, but several projects had an experimental counterpart where I designed a model based on the data obtained by my experimental colleagues.  Most of the projects are related to nanoelectronics and electron transport in quantum systems. One of my favorite parts was theoretically investigating single-molecule transistors -- devices that have the characteristics of a transistor but whose central part is made of just a single (usually organic) molecule.
